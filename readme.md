## Project Overview

A **student-friendly** patch antenna design library created by students for students, hobbyists, and RF enthusiasts. This enhanced version of the original library provides comprehensive tools for designing rectangular patch antennas with an intuitive interface and educational focus.

**Perfect for**: Students learning RF design, hobbyists building antennas, makers exploring wireless projects, and anyone interested in understanding patch antenna fundamentals.

### Key Features

- **Student-Friendly Interface**: Simple functions like `quick_design()` for rapid prototyping
- **Educational Material Database**: Common PCB substrates with clear explanations
- **Comprehensive Frequency Bands**: Pre-defined bands for WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM, and more
- **Automated Design Validation**: Helpful warnings and optimization suggestions
- **Professional Documentation**: Clear examples and educational comments
- **Direct PCB Export**: Generate Gerber files for fabrication
- **Design Comparison Tools**: Compare materials and optimize designs
- **Manufacturing Support**: Export specifications for PCB fabrication

### Technical Capabilities

- **Frequency Range**: 1 MHz to 100 GHz (perfect for student projects)
- **Material Support**: FR4, Rogers substrates, PTFE, Alumina with educational notes
- **Feed Types**: Normal edge feed and inset feed with impedance matching
- **Export Formats**: Design summaries, manufacturing specs, Gerber files
- **Validation**: Efficiency analysis, manufacturability checks, student-friendly warnings

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install patch-antenna-designer
```

Or install with development dependencies:
```bash
pip install patch-antenna-designer[dev]
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import patch_antenna as pa

# Quick design for student WiFi projects
design = pa.quick_design('WIFI_2_4GHZ', 'FR4', 1.6)
print(f"Patch: {design.patch_width*1000:.1f} x {design.patch_length*1000:.1f} mm")

# Generate files for PCB fabrication
pa.export_design_summary(design, 'my_antenna_design.txt')
pa.write_gerber_design(design, 'my_antenna.gbr', 'inset')
```

### For Students & Hobbyists

```python
# Compare different materials for your project
materials = pa.find_best_material(2.4e9, 1.6, target_impedance=50)
print(f"Best material for your project: {materials[0][0]}")

# Design with specific material
design = pa.design_with_material(2.4e9, 'FR4', 1.6)

# Get helpful warnings and tips
warnings = pa.validate_design(design)
for warning in warnings:
    print(f"üí° Tip: {warning}")
```

## Examples

### WiFi Range Extender Antenna
```python
import patch_antenna as pa

# Design a 2.4GHz patch antenna for WiFi
design = pa.quick_design('WIFI_2_4GHZ', 'FR4', 1.6)
print(f"Antenna size: {design.patch_width*1000:.1f} x {design.patch_length*1000:.1f} mm")

# Check if design is good for manufacturing
warnings = pa.validate_design(design)
if not warnings:
    print("‚úÖ Design ready for fabrication!")
else:
    for warning in warnings:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {warning}")
```

### IoT Sensor Node Antenna
```python
import patch_antenna as pa

# Design for 915MHz ISM band (common for IoT)
design = pa.design_for_band('ISM_915', 'FR4', 1.6)

# Export manufacturing files
pa.export_design_summary(design, 'iot_antenna_specs.txt')
pa.export_manufacturing_notes(design, 'manufacturing_guide.txt')
pa.write_gerber_design(design, 'iot_antenna.gbr', 'inset')
```

### Compare Materials for Student Project
```python
import patch_antenna as pa

# Find best material for your budget and performance needs
materials = pa.find_best_material(2.4e9, 1.6, target_impedance=50)

print("Material comparison for your project:")
for i, (material, design, error) in enumerate(materials[:3]):
    print(f"{i+1}. {material}: {error:.1f}Œ© error, "
          f"Size: {design.patch_width*1000:.1f}x{design.patch_length*1000:.1f}mm")
```
